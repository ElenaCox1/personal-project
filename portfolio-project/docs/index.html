The Cook Report was founded in 1984 by Charlie Cook, a former Capitol Hill staffer, campaign consultant, pollster and political action committee staff member. </p> <p>Cook ranks races on three categories: likely, lean and toss-up. Likely seats are not considered to be competitive, but have the potential to become so. Lean seats are considered competitive but one party holds the advantage. Toss-ups are the most competitive, with the potential to go to either party. </p> <img class="key_1" src="cook_rating_key-01.235074eb.png"> <div id="chart-1"></div> <script type="text/javascript" src="chart_1.274cbbca.js"></script>  <h3>But How Often is the Cook Report Correct?</h3> <p>I looked at data from the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/IG0UN2">MIT Election and Data Lab</a> to find the winners of U.S. House races from 2010 to 2018 by district. I then compared the election results to Cook's ratings over the same time period. </p> <p>Cook ratings that were likely Democrat, lean Democrat and toss-up Democrat were marked "accurate" if a Democrat won that district. I applied the same method for Republicans. In 2010, 2012 and 2014, Cook was correct around three-quarters of the time. In 2016, that number spiked to 86%, but in 2018, Cook was only right 55% of the time. </p> <img class="key_2" src="cook_accuracy_key.dca6a438.png"> <div id="chart-2"></div> <script type="text/javascript" src="chart_2.0615deb8.js"></script> </div>
